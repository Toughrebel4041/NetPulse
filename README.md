NetPulse is a basic comprehensive network scanner. It combines multiple features such as host discovery, port scanning, service detection, vulnerability detection, OS detection, banner grabbing, and logging into a single, easy-to-use tool.

```
Note: Both versions of NetPulse are still under development. The first version (NetPulse.py) only able to use some of its features, and the second version- I don't even know if it's working or just throw some random gibberish). I will finish this project asap.
```
## Features
- Host Discovery: Identifies live hosts in a given IP range.
- Port Scanning: Scans specified ports on each discovered host to find open ports.
- Service Detection: Identifies the service running on each open port.
- Vulnerability Detection: Checks identified services against a predefined list of known vulnerabilities.
- OS Detection: Guesses the operating system based on Nmapâ€™s OS detection feature.
- Banner Grabbing: Retrieves the banner of the service running on each open port.
- Logging: Logs all results to netpulse.log.
